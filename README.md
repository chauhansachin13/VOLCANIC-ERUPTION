# Volcanic Eruption Simulation

## Overview

The Volcanic Eruption Simulation project is a graphical application developed in C using the `graphics.h` library. It simulates a volcanic eruption with animated visuals including lava flow and ash clouds. This project is designed to demonstrate basic graphics programming techniques and provide an engaging visual experience of a volcanic eruption.

## Project Description

This project provides a visual simulation of a volcanic eruption. Using basic graphics primitives, it creates the appearance of lava flowing from the volcano and ash clouds rising into the sky. The goal of the project is to illustrate graphics programming concepts and provide a basic framework for graphical animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Lava Flow**: Animated lava that flows from the volcano and changes color.
- **Ash Cloud Animation**: Expanding ellipses simulate the rising ash clouds during the eruption.
- **Interactive Graphics**: Simple and intuitive graphical representation of volcanic eruption components.
- **Customizable Elements**: Easily modifiable code to adjust volcano shape, lava color, and animation speed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Volcanic Eruption Simulation, follow these instructions to set up your development environment and run the simulation.

### Prerequisites

1. **Turbo C++ IDE** or any compatible C compiler that supports `graphics.h`.
2. **Graphics Library Files**:
   - `graphics.h`
   - `conio.h`
   - `winbgim.h` (if using Turbo C++ on Windows)

### Installation

1. **Install Turbo C++**:
   - Download and install Turbo C++ from a trusted source.
   - Follow the provided instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Set Up Graphics Library**:
   - Place the `graphics.h` and `winbgim.h` files in the `include` directory of Turbo C++.
   - Ensure the corresponding BGI files are in the `BGI` directory specified by the IDE settings.

### Configuration

1. **Configure Turbo C++ IDE**:
   - Open Turbo C++ IDE and go to the `Options` menu.
   - Select `Directories` and set the path for the `Include` and `Library` directories where the graphics files are located.
   - Set the `BGI` path to the directory containing the BGI files.

2. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Compile and run a basic graphics test program to ensure that the setup is correct.

## Code Explanation

### Initialization

```c
int gd = DETECT, gm;
initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:\\Turboc3\\bgi");
```

- **`gd` and `gm`**: Variables for graphics driver and mode. `DETECT` automatically detects the graphics driver.
- **`initgraph`**: Initializes the graphics system. The path `"C:\\Turboc3\\bgi"` must be replaced with the correct path to your BGI files.

### Drawing Components

#### Volcano Base

```c
setcolor(6);
rectangle(0, 380, 300, 400);
setfillstyle(1, 6);
floodfill(1, 381, 6);
```

- **`rectangle`**: Draws the base of the volcano.
- **`floodfill`**: Fills the rectangle with color to represent the ground.

#### Volcano Structure

```c
int trpz[] = {349, 380, 325, 150, 324, 150, 300, 380};
drawpoly(4, trpz);
```

- **`drawpoly`**: Draws a polygon representing the volcano's shape. The array `trpz` defines the vertices of the polygon.

### Animation Details

#### Lava Flow

```c
for(k = 0; k < 300; k++)
{
    setcolor(14);
    line(0 + k, 420, 0 + k, 435);
    delay(10);
}
```

- **`line`**: Draws vertical lines to simulate the lava flow. The `for` loop creates an animation effect by shifting the lines over time.
- **`delay`**: Controls the speed of the animation.

#### Eruption Simulation

```c
for (; i < 27 && j < 400;)
{
    if (j < 80)
        setcolor(14);
    else if (j >= 80 && j < 200)
        setcolor(LIGHTRED);
    else if (j > 255 && j < 400)
    {
        setcolor(4);
        pieslice(325, 185, 50, 130, 55);
    }
    else
        setcolor(RED);
    line(300 + i, 400 - j, 350 - i, 400 - j);
    delay(20);
    i = i + 0.1;
    j = j + 1;
}
```

- **`pieslice`**: Draws slices representing the eruption of lava. The color changes simulate the different stages of the eruption.
- **`line`**: Draws moving lines representing the lava flow as it erupts.

### Final Touches

```c
setcolor(4);
line(325, 125, 325, 90);
line(340, 125, 350, 92);
line(355, 130, 380, 108);
line(365, 150, 398, 150);
line(360, 165, 389, 190);
line(310, 125, 300, 92);
line(295, 130, 272, 111);
line(285, 150, 260, 150);
line(293, 165, 273, 188);
```

- **`line`**: Draws the ash clouds rising from the volcano, adding the final visual details to the simulation.

## Running the Simulation

1. **Compile the Code**:
   - Open Turbo C++ IDE.
   - Load the source code file.
   - Compile the code using the compile option in the IDE.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - After successful compilation, run the program.
   - The simulation window will open, displaying the volcanic eruption animation.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Graphics Not Displaying

- **Issue**: The graphics window does not open or displays an error.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the path to the BGI directory is correctly set in your IDE configuration. Check that the graphics library files are in the correct locations.

### Compilation Errors

- **Issue**: Errors during compilation.
- **Solution**: Verify that all necessary library files (`graphics.h`, `conio.h`, etc.) are correctly included and accessible. Check for typos or syntax errors in the code.

### Program Crashes

- **Issue**: The program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the graphics mode initialization is correct. Verify that the `initgraph` function is provided with the correct path to the BGI files.

## Extending the Project

You can extend this project by adding additional features:

- **Interactive Controls**: Add keyboard or mouse controls to interact with the simulation.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve the graphics quality with more advanced techniques or libraries.
- **User Input**: Allow users to customize the simulation parameters, such as eruption intensity or lava color.
